          '“Marvelous” is how one reader succinctly described the experience at this year’s top hotel. Another said the property has the “best personalized service. Staff is super attentive, and the Bill Bensley design is unique.” The star designer’s efforts are surrounded by small villages, shrines, and acres of green rice paddies in Ubud’s Keliki Valley — another strong point, voters said. A suspension bridge leads guests here to their tented suites, and the interiors have the aura of an old-world explorer’s hideaway — but in the most luxurious way, with teak flooring, vintage steamer trunks, and antique furnishings. Here, guests feel truly immersed in the jungle, with dense forest on all sides and the River Wos rushing below. “It’s a magical experience on the isle of gods,” as one guest said.',
